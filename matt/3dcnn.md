## Abstract

Lesion detection on CT scan images is challenging due to low contrast of sot tissue and similar appearance between lesion and background
3D context can improve detection accuracy
Previous mthods - 3D CNN with sliding window or acts only on local patches or conctenate feature maps of 2D CNNs - less effective to capture 3D info
Hybrid detector proposed here combines these methods
- Several 3D CNNs as subnets to bridge 2D CNNs' intermediate features
Method surpasses SOTA on DeepLesion dataset

## Intro

Challenges: 
3D CNNs can only be used on small patches in sliding-window fashion, or on small-patch candidates generated by a 2D detectore, due to GPU memory limit
and can't use ImageNet pretraining

Other idea: Use 2D CNN features from consecutive slices for classification / regression to somewhat use 3D context. This can use ImageNet pretraining.
Backbone network takes whole CT scan as input; however, independent 2D CNNs used here mean 3D info can't be aggregated until final backbone features are computed.

Proposed method:

Use 2D CNNs for slices at different axial locations as backbone
Use light-weighted 3D CNNs subsets ("3D Fusion Modules") to bridge 2D CNNs, allowing info. flow from different slices

## Approach
![img](https://i.ibb.co/9Wqt3Kw/image.png)
Stack 3 CT slices to use ImageNet pretrained weights (3 channels)
Combine context slices and feed them to different VGG16 branches
RPN is used to generate proposals (green)
Concatenation of features from all slices (blue) used in region classiffication network
3D Fusion model uses a 4D tensor (channel, height, width, K input images = K intermediate features)
3DFN can be inserted anywhere in backbone CNNs to fuse 3D info
In their network, only inserted in pool3 and conv4_3 layers in VGG
This combines those independent VGG branches sparesely into a bridged 3D CNN

## Experiments 
The detector works on 8 types of lesions and outperforms eexisting methods, establishing a new SOTA. It outperforms a baseline method and is valid in some difficult cases, too.
