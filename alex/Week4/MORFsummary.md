# MORF -

## What is MORF?
* An extension of the decision forest classifier to function in structured data environments, e.g images.
* Must take into account the closeness of data points

## Background
* SPORF/Random forest explanations, same deal

## Manifold Methods
* Optimization and node splitting done in the same manner as SPORF
* To obtain relevance of neighboring units of structured data, MF creates projections by summing intensities of the unit data in rectangular patches.
