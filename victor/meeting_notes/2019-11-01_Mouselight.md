## Estimates for TIme to Convolve on io50

* Fastest window size is the size of the tif image

## Mean intensities of tif files

* channel 0: most intensities are clustered between 11 000 to 12 500
* ranges from 2000 to 12 500
* conclusion: should center data

## Representative sections

* Otsu thresholding 
* will use smoothing before otsu thresholding

## Ideas to Convert Skeletons to Pixel Segmentations

* segment on 3D volumes; start with labeling where the skeletons are present

## Swc files visible on neuroglancer

* showing all ocnsensus neurons on lvl 1
* created python script to upload swcs to S3 for visualization
