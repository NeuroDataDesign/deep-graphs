# 2019-10-01 MouseLight Retrieval Functions meeting #1
* some code already set up in Tommy's private repo
  * add Matt, Stanley, and Victor to the private repo directly for now
  * consider adding repo to neurodata design organization in the future
* data on CIS account
  * to test functions, need to be able to access data in CIS
  * data is located in `/cis/local/jacs/data/jacsstorage/samples/2018-08-01`
  * MouseLight is not a single volume but a collection of sub-cube volumes distributed in a directory tree
  * need permission to view "samples" folder

* issues to solve with data retrieval functions:
  * need to convert discrete voxels to spatial coordinates
  * searching for particular area that spans multiple sub-cubes

# TODOs:
* Tommy:
  * invite Matt's, Stanely's, and Victor's github accounts as collaborators to his repo
  * Ask Ben (NDD TA) how to best make MouseLight retrieval functions repo visible to them so that Victor, Stanley, and Matt can present the code at weekly presentations
* Victor:
  * ask Anthony for read permission into /cis/local/jacs/data/jacsstorage/samples/2018-08-01
  * add Tommy to slack
  * take a look at Mouselight data and understand how the volume is structured
* Matt & Stanley
  * get CIS accounts from Anthony
  * take a look at Mouselight data and understand how the volume is structured
