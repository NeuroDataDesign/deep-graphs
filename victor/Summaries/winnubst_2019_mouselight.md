## Abstract
Neuronal cell types are the nodes of neural circuits that determine the flow of information within the brain. Neuronal morphology, especially the shape of the axonal arbor, provides an essential descriptor of cell type and reveals how individual neurons route their output across the brain. Despite the importance of morphology, few projection neurons in the mouse brain have been reconstructed in their entirety. Here we present a robust and efficient platform for imaging and reconstructing complete neuronal morphologies, including axonal arbors that span substantial portions of the brain. We used this platform to reconstruct more than 1,000 projection neurons in the motor cortex, thalamus, subiculum, and hypothalamus. Together, the reconstructed neurons comprise more than 75 meters of axonal length and are available in a searchable online database. Axonal shapes revealed previously unknown subtypes of projection neurons and suggest organizational principles of long-range connectivity.

## Introduction

## Method Details

### Animals
* wild-type C57BL/6 animals, Rorb-IRES2-Cre transgeneic, and Sim1-Cre transgenic animals

* healthy, had access to *ad libitum* food and water, and housed in enriched environment

### Viral labeling
* sparse labelling
* C57/BL6 injected with adeno associated virus expressing Cre-recombinase (AAV syn-iCre) and high-titer reporter virus coding for fluorescent reporter
* Rorb-IRES2-Cre: diluted Cre-dependent FLP-recombinase and FLP-dependent reporter virus
* Sim1-Cre: systemic injection via retro-orbital sinus with Cre-dependent FLP-recombinase and FLP-dependent reporter virus
