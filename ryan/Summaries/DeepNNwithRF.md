A Deep Neural Network Model using Random Forest to Extract Feature Representation for Gene Expression Data Classification
Kong, Yu

- claims works well when with sparse learning, n << p 
- binary classification, each data point is fed to forest, each tree in forest outputs classification, these classifications are concatenated and then fed into a neural net
- apparently outperforms RF and DNN methods, but not always RF?
