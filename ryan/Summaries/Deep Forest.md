Deep Forest
Zhi-Hua Zhou, Ji Feng


- can deep learning be achieved wih non-differentiable modules
- deep model completely composed of cascade of RF (gcForest)
- authors hypothesize that DNNs are successful because of layer-by-layer processing, in-model feature transformation, and sufficient model complexity

###Gc Forest ##
- cascade structure
- each level is ensemble of forests, different types of forests used
- use completely-random tree forests and random forests
- completely-random tree forests randomly select a feature to split and grow until each leaf contains only 1 class
- Each forest will estimate class distribution; vectors are concatenated with original feature vector to form input to next level
- if more augmented features can be created, then it can be helfup (look at other nodes?)
- class vector produced by each forest is generated by k-fold cross validation
- multi-grained scanning -> use a sliding window can use different slides
