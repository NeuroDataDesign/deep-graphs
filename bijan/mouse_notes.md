### mouselight

neural citcuits in the mouse brain determine flow of information. The shape of the axonal arbor is the most important descriptor of cell type, and reveals how the neurons route their output. Despite this, few neurons have actually been mapped. mouselight is a project which reconstructed more than 1000 projection neurons in the motor cortex, thalamus, subiculum, and hypothalamus.
